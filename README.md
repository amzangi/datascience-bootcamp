I got interested in Data Science from my first role when I started creating macros in Excel. Little did I know it will carry me to something fascinating. 

I looked into online turorials/books and found Jake VanderPlas's amazing beginner's book - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ . The key is to type out the commands and go from start to finish as much as possible. I should have listened to my own advice th efirst time I found the book. Please don't waste time looking for a perfect book/turorial and just dive in.

If someone is looking to wet his feets into the world of Data Analytics look no further. Just follow along the excercises and keep the book as your guide. I am uploading data sources as well to help the seekers, since the links in the book were not working and might discourage the learners.
