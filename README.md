I got interested in Data Science from my first role when I started creating macros in Excel. Little did I know it will carry me to something fascinating. 

### ENTER PYTHON ###

I looked into online turorials/books and found Jake VanderPlas's amazing [beginner's book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) . The key is to type out the commands and go from start to finish as much as possible. I should have listened to my own advice the first time I found the book. Please don't waste time looking for a perfect book/turorial and just dive in.

If someone is looking to wet his feets into the world of Data Analytics, look no further. Just follow along the exercises and keep the book as your guide. I am uploading data sources as well (You're Welcome) to help the seekers, since the links in the book were not working and might discourage the learners.

I chose to use Google Colabs as they are incredibly easy to use and you can start without any downloads. I am in the process of updating the scripts where possible, since some functions are deprecated.

_1. [Introduction](https://github.com/amzangi/datascience-bootcamp/blob/master/1_Introduction.ipynb)_
It talks about launching the notebooks and introduces the reader to helpful documentation and shortcuts.
_2. [Introduction to NumPy](https://github.com/amzangi/datascience-bootcamp/blob/master/2_Numpy.ipynb)_
Here we learn about numpyâ€™s abilities to load, store and manipulate in-memory data.

_3. Data Manipulation with Pandas_
Now comes pandas which is built on numpy. It uses Dataframe and Series objects for manipulating data. I divided it into 2 manageable chunks.

[Part b](https://github.com/amzangi/datascience-bootcamp/blob/master/3b_Pandas.ipynb)

_4. [Visualization with Matplotlib](https://github.com/amzangi/datascience-bootcamp/blob/master/4_Matplotlib.ipynb)_
Matplotlib is a library in Python used for visualization.

_5. [Machine Learning: Naive Bayes Classification](https://github.com/amzangi/datascience-bootcamp/blob/master/5_Machine_Learning_Naive_Bayes.ipynb)_
This chapter introduces us to mahcine learning where I attempted naive Bayes classification.
