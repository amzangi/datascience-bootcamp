I got interested in Data Science from my first role when I started creating macros in Excel. Little did I know it will carry me to something fascinating. 

I looked into online turorials/books and found Jake VanderPlas's book (https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) amazing for a beginner. The key was to type out the commands and go from start to finish as much as possible.

If someone is looking to wet his feets into the world of Data Analytics look no further. Just follow along the excercises and keep the book as your guide.
